# Exercise: Pulling and pushing the changes

## Overview

This exercise requires you to pull the latest change from the main branch
(master) in the remote server. And then create your branch, make your changes,
and push your changes back to the remote server. The exercise is a actually
simulation of the real world scenario. These steps would be what you need to
do every day.

- Run `sh setup.sh` to setup the environment.

- Navigate to the "MyProject" (`cd MyProject`)

- Create a new working branch

- Switch to your new working branch

- Pull the latest changes from remote (`git pull origin master`)

- Append one more line "Bye bye" to the file "hello.txt"

- Add your changes to staged status and commit the changes

- Push your changes to the remote (`git push origin <your_branch_name>`)
