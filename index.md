# Why version control?

Have you ever met one of these problems?

- The code I did last night worked. I wish I could revert it back.

- I have to copy the same file to maintain multiple versions, and now I don't know their differences and don't know which one to choose.

- I want someone else to participate in my work, but I don't want him to overwrite my progress.

# Git and its history

Git is a distributed version-control system, created by Linus Torvalds (who is also the creator of Linux kernel) in 2005, originally designed for efficiently handling large projects like Linux kernel.

People may get confused with git and github. Git is a command-line tool for version control. While github is a website that user can share and even collaborate on their git repositories.

# Getting a repository

A Repository is a location that you keep all the files related to your project.

We can either create a new repository (`git init`), or get an existing repository from somewhere else (`git clone`).
